  Monday to Friday, I tell computers what to do for money. On the weekends, I tell computers what to do for fun.
  I have experience in AI models' QA and regulation compliance, but mostly in backend development and implementing end-to-end data pipelines with Python.
  I am now building software in C at 42 Berlin, where I am completing my SWE education. Currently based in Berlin, Germany.
