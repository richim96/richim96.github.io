  Hi there! I am a software developer originally from Italy, but I cannot stay still in any one country.
  Despite a non-traditional background in software engineering, I have grown very passionate about backend and database design,
  as well as the implementation of data pipelines. On the side, I am currently working on a mobile game and a stock-tracking app.
  If you are interested in exploring a collaboration, feel free to reach out to me.
