  Hi there! I am a software developer originally from Italy, but I seem incapable of staying still in any one country.
  Despite my non-traditional background in software engineering, I have grown very passionate about backend and database design,
  as well as the implementaion of data pipelines. On the side, I am working on a text-based game and a stock-tracking app for financial professionals and amateurs.
  If you are interested in exploring a collaboration, feel free to reach out anytime.
