  Hello there! I am an Italian software engineer now living in Berlin, Germany.
  Despite a non-traditional background in software engineering, I am now making my way into the field. I have some experience analysing
  AI systems' compliance with EU regulations, but mostly with database design (SQL/NoSQL) and the implementation of end-to-end data pipelines with Python.
  I am now expanding my proficiency to C programming as well. If you are insterested in my profile for internships or entry-level positions, please reach out anytime.
